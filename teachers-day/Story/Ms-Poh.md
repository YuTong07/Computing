### History lesson

- the lessons can be quite dry but ms poh encourages us to push on because it gets more interesting in y3 and y4
- ms poh's jokes are very relatable
- history can be hard because we have to memorise so many things, but through many practices we improve
- funfact: ms poh was actually a geog student, even she thought as a kid that geog was easier, she said that for Geography its just memorising :/ 
- we still love history the same though :))
-MS POH IS AWESOME :DDD
