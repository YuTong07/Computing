### On a pleasant day in 1F,

Mr Lee and Mdm Juwana step into the classroom for attendance taking.

**Narrator:**
Ah, let's introduce our two form teachers!

First, we have Mr Lee. He teaches us chemistry, biology, physics, all in one subject called Science.
In his lessons, we learn about how the world works.
Although it can be quite confusing for some topics, but Mr Lee patiently guides us again and again.
He is a very nice, patient and caring form teacher too who likes to write long messages so that we do not have any misunderstandings.

Next, we have Mdm Juwana, our English teacher. We like having English because it doesn't have a thick textbok to weigh down our schoolbags.
Our classroom is always filled with laughter at Mdm Juwana's jokes.

**Narrator**
From the corner of our eyes, we see a radiant smile and a petite teacher.
That's right, it is Mr Chan and Ms Poh!

It's time to learn about the world. From reading maps
to things like housing shortage,
latitudes and longtitudes,
meaningful places
and water, Mr Chan, our geography teacher covers them all.
With life skills and general knowledge, all in one place, we truly enjoy Geography.
Mr Chan's constant bright aura also helps us feel better,
making us stay awake for the rest of the day at school.

Moving on, we have Ms Poh, our history teacher. The lessons can be quite dry,
but Ms Poh encourages us to push on because it gets more interesting in Y3 and Y4.
Just another 2-3 years before we can start learning about wars!
Ms Poh's jokes are very relatable, making us crack up even if we feel very dead at the end of the day.
History can be hard because we have to memorise so many things, but through many practices we improve steadily.
Funfact: Ms Poh was actually a Geography student. She thought that geog was easier at our age, since Geography was just memorising to her.
Her consultations are also very interesting, although we normally stray away from the topic of History
and start asking her about her personal life instead.
Even after all that, we all love History the same because Ms Poh is also an awesome teacher!

**Narrator:**
Then, it is time to move on to the languages.

As Jiang Lao Shi is seen walking into class, 
our classmates are once again seen writing furiously, trying to complete the last of our Chinese homework.
We swear we don't hold any grudges against Jiang Lao Shi but the towering mountain of Chinese homework never seems to lessen.
However, Chinese is one of the harder subjects, and Jiang Lao Shi tries her best to save our Chinese grades.

An unfamiiliar language travels to our ears... Ah, it's Malay!
Cikgu Nora steps into class brightly, making us feel ready to learn a new language.
We may not be proficient in Malay, but Cikgu Nora still makes the classes fun, with small pockets of competitions
held amongst each row of tables.

**Narrator:**
Moving to the track, we see two sporty teachers.

Ms Lee, our PE teacher waves to us from the track, so we run to make sure that we are not late. 
PE is a time where we can run, throw and jump to our hearts' content.
It was a little better before Covid-19 came where we could play in teams without masks,
but PE is still enjoyable nonetheless.
The mini inter-cass competitions are very exciting. Even though we are not the best in the level at a specific sport, 
if we all work together, we can showcase our class spirit 
and ultimately still get first place.

Mr Leo blows his whistle to get our attention, pleased that we made an effort to come on time for his lesson.
Mod PE is not to be confused with normal PE, Mod PE is where we learn survival skills like 
knot tying, shelter building and setting up of tents.
It is a place where we can show off our creativity, and he is always so patient when explaining how to tie the knots,
never getting mad even if we struggle with knots.
These are good skills to learn if we ever got stranded in the jungle someday. 

**Narrator:**
A tranquil melody floats across the room, and the splashing of paint across canvas is heard. It is truly a battle of the arts.

Mr Goh, our music teacher, teaches us how to play many instruments 
from traditional ones like the Malay kompangs to using various objects to create sound for a movie.
One of my personal favourites was using the IPad Garage Band to drum out the beat
of classic pop and rock songs.
We like the occasional free movie screenings too!

Ms Zakia, our art teacher, puts up with us
fooling around (sorry art teachers),
but we still enjoy art lesson because we can express ourselves through drawing on proper paper
instead of out worksheets.
It is generally quite a free and easygoing lesson, and
we have quite a fun time trying to explain our art to the teachers.

**Narrator:**
This time, we see three human figures. One is tapping furiously away on the computer in front of him, 
the light from the computer reflecting off his glasses.
One is sitting deep in thought, analysing two different sheets of data.
And the last one is designing something on his computer, making the outline of something that resembles a cookie box.

Mr Ho, our computing teacher, patiently tries to explain the lesson objectives.
We struggle quite a lot but we have the most fun in computing lessons.
Coding can be hard to pick up but the computing teachers are really helpful in helping us get the work done.
We would like to give an honourary mention to Mr Mark Leonard - he's a very chill teacher as well!

Mr Yap, our TRP teacher for the even index numbers waits for our return to the classroom.
TRP is where we use our brains and think the most and learn how to solve solutions better.
Our brains may hurt after the lesson but it is mostly worth it.
The debates held were very interesting to see and experience, so thank you Mr Yap
for giving us the time to carry the debates out!

Mr Low, our makerspace teacher, feeds the design he just made into the laser cutter, 
which cuts the wood into precise shapes. It may have been very troublesome to understand how to get the 
dimensions of the cookie boxes right, especially
when we had to learn to use the software at home.
Still, Mr Low held google meets for us to clarify our doubts.
In the end, most of us were able to produce decent cookie boxes as a reward for our effort.
His way of starting his lessons by taking our minds off school were also 
very interesting, and I think it showed that
he really cared for his students' wellbeing.
